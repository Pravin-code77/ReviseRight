ReviseRight — AI-Powered Flashcard & Revision App

📌 Overview

ReviseRight is a full-stack AI-powered mobile flashcard and revision application with an integrated multi-language code compiler. It helps students revise faster using AI-generated flashcards, spaced repetition, and simplified study notes.

The app is built with React Native (Expo) and a Node.js/Express backend, and uses Google Gemini AI to convert complex notes into concise bullet points or ASCII-style visual diagrams. It also includes a built-in multi-language code compiler powered by the Piston API, allowing users to write, run, and test code directly inside the app.
